      <h1>Octopussy</h1>
      <p>So I was dicking around with <a href="http://coderwall.com/icco" title="icco on CodeWall">CodeWall</a>, and I got the Octopussy badge. This was really awesome, but I had no idea who from GitHub was following my projects. So I decided to write me some JavaScript to figure it out.</p>
