# Octopussy

An attempt to list all githubers who are following you.

Uses [fitzgen's github-api](https://github.com/fitzgen/github-api).

## TODO

 * Actually get the watchers list
 * make less api requests
 * stop using the api wrapper, just do it by hand.
 * don't hardcode the github employees, use the api instead.
